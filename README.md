# Power Regulator Shield for Arduino UNO

This is a guided project offered by Altium Education on which I was able to put into practice my Altium skills with an emphasis on designing a PCB. The idea of this project was to simulate as if I were working as a professional designer at an engineering services company, and that someone would give me the requirements of this project

# Project Requirements

The requirements were the following:

1.	Receive power from a 12 V DC input
2.	Regulate power down to 5 V DC
3.	Deliver 12 V DC power to a bank of 2 LED lights in parallel
4.	Provide 5 V DC power to the main Arduino Uno board
5.	Provide enough current to power the Arduino and the LEDs
6.	Regulate power with at least 90% efficiency
7.	LEDs must be SMD parts with high power output (at least 10 W each)
8.	Power input connection is provided by standard 16 AWG wire
9.	Components must be placed only on the top layer
10.	Total board thickness must be standard thickness (1.6mm)
